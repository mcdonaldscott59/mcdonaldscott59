- 👋 Hi, I’m @mcdonaldscott59
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning about printers, printing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...everything I can
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Voron 2.4 R2 .cfg files
- 📫 How to reach me ... mcdonaldscott59@yahoo.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... Bought this Voron 2.4 R2 assembled with multiple upgrades on an auction, shipping did a number on it, had to rewire it, replace boards, etc.
- Thought it'd be a good idea to just start from scratch so reinstalled Klipper and all the firmware . . . I then lewarned what a
- printer.cfg file is. Still working on it but getting closer. My first printer was an Ender 3 V3 KE in July.
